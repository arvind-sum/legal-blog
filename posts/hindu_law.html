                    <p class="blog-heading">EVOLUTION OF HINDU SUCCESSION LAW</p>
                    <p>Traditionally there has been two major Schools of thought with respect to the succession in India namely the Mitakshara and the Dayabhaga school. The Mitakshara school has divided the property ownership into Obstructed (<em>apratibandha daya</em>) and Unobstructed Heritage (<em>saptratibandha daya</em>). Ownership based on Unobstructed heritage was collective or coparcenary, and this ownership is gained through birth and death in the family of the coparcenor (principle of survivorship). To elaborate, as the right in the property is gained through birth, existence of a prior owner doesn’t obstruct the newborn from gaining ownership over the property by birth in the family. The property being collectively owned can not be alienated individually by any member. Every such member shall have the right to request partition of the property to gain separate ownership. This collective ownership was standardly carried between four successive generations.  </p>
                    <p>The patriarchal norms of this school of thought can be clearly seen from the fact that the membership in the said collective ownership was limited to the male members of the family. The ratio behind this arbitrary norm roots from the assumption of considering the women to be the part of her Husbands family. This way female members of the family only have the right to maintenance in their family and no right in the ownership over an unobstructed heritage except for certain legislative exceptions <sup>1</sup>. Obstructed heritage is essentially separate property owned by individuals. Herein, any interest in the property shall be vested only by inheriting the said property after the demise of the previous owner. In other words, the existence of the owner obstructs another from accruing right in the said property. Such property can be inherited by female counterparts in the family.</p>

                    <p>Similarly, Dayabhaga school was based on the spiritual benefit. That is the person who give the highest level of spiritual benefit to a dead person has the eligibility to inherit latter’s property. The collective ownership over the property only shifts to the next generation upon death of a last person of a prior generation. Even this ownership is limited to the male members of the family. But Dayabhaga law recognised female interest in the property by providing life interest to the widow upon the death of the respective male member.  </p>
                    <p>Post independence the first legislative interference to strike gender equality in inheritance laws was initiated through the Hindu Code Bill of 1948 which tried to abolish the concepts of Hindu joint family and coparcenary and provided for a uniform scheme of inheritance of the property. This bill was not enacted due to the heavy opposition of conservationist Hindu wings, claiming the disintegration of Hindu family units in India.</p>

                    <p><b>Hindu Succession Act Of 1956 </b></p>
                    <p>This led to Hindu Succession Act of 1956 which was intended to strike down  a balance between the reformist and the conservationists by taking a piecemeal approach towards eliminating the patriarchal concept of Coparcenary property. Section 6 of this act created and mandated the fictional practice of Notional Partition which is triggered only in the presence of a first class female member of the family of the deceased. In Notional partition, the law presumes the deceased member to have requested a partition right before his death, thereby making his share in the coparcenary property as his separate property which is subject to inheritance by his heirs including his first class female heirs  (conversion of a part of the property from unobstructed to obstructed heritage).</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Separate property, the act through Section 14(1) transformed any limited interest/share  possessed by a female in furtherance of pre-existed right prior to 1956  to an absolute interest /share in the property.</p>

                    <p><b>Hindu Succession Amendment Act of 2005</b></p>
                    <p>Though, this amendment was a delayed move following several state legislations which abolished Joint Hindu Family System<sup>2</sup>, it has been the most progressive central legislative interference enacted in the history of Hindu Succession Laws. This amendment through Section 6 placed the daughters in the same pedestal as the son in a Hindu Family by making them a coparcener by birth and thus making them entitled to a share equal to son’s share in the coparcenary property for all the partitions that happens on or after 20th December 2004. Additionally, it also mandated the practice of notional partition irrespective of the presence of a first class female heir.</p>

                    <p><b>Gurupad Khandappa Magdum vs Hirabai Khandappa Magdum And Ors<sup>3</sup></b></p>
                    <p>Justice Y Chandrachud in this Supreme Court case held, Furthering the legislative intent of the act to provide women with the property is to be the primary consideration while interpreting the provision of the Hindu Succession Act of 1956.</p>
                    <blockquote>“Interpretation furthers the legislative intent in regard to the enlargement of the share of female heirs, qualitatively  and  quantitatively.  Even assuming  that two interpretations of Explanation 1 are reasonably possible, Courts must prefer that interpretation which will further the  intention of the legislature and remedy  the  injustice from which the Hindu women have suffered over the years. By restricting the operation of the fiction created by Explanation  I	 in the manner suggested by the appellant, Courts, shall  be taking a retrograde step, putting back as it were the clock of social reform which has enabled the Hindu women to acquire  an equal status with males in matters  of property.”</blockquote>

                    <p><b>Vineeta Sharma vs Rakesh Sharma<sup>4</sup></b></p>
                    <p>This case overruled the ratios upheld by the Supreme Court in serveral cases<sup>5</sup> including  Prakash & Others v Phulavati & Others<sup>6</sup>. In the latter judgement the court upheld the two basic conditions to be fulfilled for the daughters to be eligible to claim under the 2005 amendment. Firstly, the partition ought not to have taken place before 20th December 2004. Secondly, the amended section would be applicable to the daughter only if her father was alive on the date when the amendment came into force, that is, September 9, 2005.</p>
                    <p>The apex court in Vineeta Sharma vs Rakesh Sharma held the second condition as void thereby overruling the previous judgement. Additionally the court observed the amendment to be retro active in nature.</p>

                    <p class="blog-heading">STEPS FURTHER</p>
                    <p>Though through Judicial and legislative interferences have been progressive steps in striking gender equality in the Hindu Succession Act  there is further scope for improvement. The Act is yet regressive in several ways such as</p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>The 2005 amendment is limited to providing the daughters with coparcenary rights while leaving out other female members of the family</li>
                        <li>The act provides different Scheme of intestate succession for men and women. Under section 15 the separate property of a women flows to different heirs with respective to the roots of such property which is not the case for men. Men under section 8 have a standardised classes of hierarchy through which all of his separate property shall flow irrespective of its roots. This differentiation roots from the patriarchal norm of considering women to a part of husbands family. That is, the Husbands heirs have a upper status over her natal family in inheriting any her separate properties (except for the property she inherits from her parents) after her death. </li>
                        <li>The act prefers Agnates (relations connected whole through males) over cognates (relation not connected wholly through males) even if the former is remoter in relationship to the deceased. </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>These are few apparent areas that are explicitly gender discriminatory and require reformation.</p>

They enacted state amendments to the HSA to give daughters coparcenary rights equal to that of sons, and to eradicate the dowry system through positive measures of empowerment.
