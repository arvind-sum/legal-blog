                    <p>The term ‘Interim’ literally means ‘during the intervening time. There can be several circumstances during the pendency of a civil case (suit/petition) wherein one of the parties might seek immediate relief in absence of granting which he/she/they would be put at a disadvantage. Interim orders root from the equity principle – <em>‘Actus Curiae Neminem Gravabit’</em> which means <em>‘An Act of the Court shall prejudice no man’</em>. Here the term ‘Act’ can be understood to cover both acts or omissions. So Interim Orders (herein referred as I.O) can be understood as temporary orders passed by the court which are valid only during the pendency of the civil case. Interim orders are equitable reliefs wholly at the discretion of the court.</p>

                    <p class="blog-heading">TYPES OF INTERIM ORDERS</p>

                    <ol type="1">
                        <b><li>Injunctions (Temporary)</li></b>
                          <p> S.36 of the Specific Relief Act of 1963 defines an injunction as a <em>‘Preventive Relief’</em> granted at the discretion of the court. A nuanced yet essential aspect to be observed here is – by the term <em>‘preventive’</em> the legislation doesn’t restrict itself to orders that are negative in nature (order to refrain from doing something), but rather includes both positive or negative orders but with the intention of preventing the breach of a duty/obligation.</p>
                          <p>Illustration -</p>
                          <p>A intends to build an Iron Gate across the common pathway shared and in dispute between both A and B. Here Injunction can be both positive or negative orders in reference to the time they are claimed.</p>
                              <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                                  <li>If A has not initiated the act of installing the gate, before which B petitioned the court for an injunction, the court here may pass a temporary injunction which shall restrict (negative order) A from installing the iron gate with the intention of preventing A from breaching his duty to not interfere with B’s right to use the pathway in dispute during the pendency of the suit. </li>
                                  <li>If A has already installed the iron gate, only after which B approaches the court, then here the court may a temporary injunction ordering A to remove the iron gate (a positive order) to prevent A from breaching his duty to not interfere with B’s right to use the pathway in dispute during the pendency of the suit. These positive injunctions are defined under S.39 of the Specific Relief Act as ‘Mandatory Injunctions’</li>
                              </ul>
                          <p>Therefore Injunctions are orders with the intention to prevent a person from committing the breach of a duty or obligation. Interim orders as the name suggest can only be on a temporary basis till the pendency of the civil case. Therefore Injunctions under the scope of Interim Orders can only be temporary injunctions. Though injunctions in general as defined under the S.37 of the Specific Relief Act can either be Temporary/Permanent. Only difference between them being, a permanent injunction can only be made decree at the end of the suit/petition and not during the pendency of a case.</p>

                          <p><b>The immediacy of Relief – Significance</b> </p>

                          <p>The immediacy of the relief has a lot of significance in this process of granting an Interim Injunction. Some reliefs can be so urgent, wherein, if the court refuses or delays to pass such orders immediately the party would be put at a severe disadvantage or an irreparable injury. In such cases the court acting contrary to the principles of natural justice – <em>‘Audi Alterim Partem’</em> goes on to pass an order ex-parte (without hearing the other side). Such orders are called <em>‘Ad-Interim Injunctions’</em>. </p>
                          <p><b>Procedure and Elements of an Interim Injunction</b> </p>
                          <p>As explained above, the courts has the power to pass temporary orders which is valid until the period prescribed in the order or till the case reaches finality. The process of granting such an interim order is as follows </p>
                              <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                                  <li>Interim/Interlocutory Application(I.A) separate from the pleading is filed in the court by the party seeking Interim Relief along with an affidavit in accordance with order 39, rule 1 of Civil Procedure Code.</li>
                                  <li>The court looks into such sought relief in the context of the circumstances of the parties. Indian Supreme court through the case <em>M/S Gujarat Pottling Co.Ltd. & Ors vs The Coca Cola Co. & Ors<sup>1</sup></em> has laid down circumstantial elements a court has to verify for granting an Interim Injunction.</li>
                                    <p> </p>
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>There is a Prima Facie dispute - A prima facie dispute is defined by the House of Lords in American Cyanamid v. Ethicon <sup>2</sup>  is <em>“the claim that’s not frivolous and vexatious; in other words, that there is a serious question to be tried”</em>. The phrase ‘real question to be tried’ is further elaborated as – <em>‘any dispute is a question that can be tried unless the petitioner fails to discussion close any real possibility of succeeding at the trial’</em></li>
                                        <li>Balance of Convenience favours the granting of the Interim order - The Balance of Convenience is basically determining whether the granting or refusing of the order shall cause the least sum injury.</li>
                                        <li>Irreparable injury – The petitioner in addition to the above said elements shall also prove that <em>the plaintiff would suffer an irreparable injury if his prayer for interlocutory injunction is disallowed.<sup>3</sup></em></li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p><b>Common law Method – </b></p>
                                    <p>The House of Lords in the American dynamic case had laid down slightly varied method with only two elements. The courts for granting an I.O shall only verify is there is </p>

                                    <p> Whereas, when an ad-Interim Injunction is ordered, the respondent, on coming to know about the same on approaching the court, shall be given a chance to present his/her/their written statement in reference to this I.A.
